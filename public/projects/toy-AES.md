# Toy AES Implementation
This is a rudimentary and very insecure implementation of
AES in C++. The reason for the insecurity comes from the
assignments description, since this project was developed
in my undergraduate experience.

The goal was to show an understanding of the different
parts of AES's encryption algorithm. Different sections of my
implementation could be subsituted for more sophisticated algorithms
(as is intended by the AES manual and standards).

This project was completed in my cybersecurity course on November 12, 2021.
I also used skills that I learned in my cryptography course from the
semester prior to complete this assignment.

# Los Angeles Mountains Website
This project was a skills test that I completed in 1 hour for an
interview at Coalition Technologies. Though the interview didn't
require any responsiveness added to the website (the requirement
was to create a pixel perfect rendition of the design they sent),
I added in my response where responsiveness would be useful for
the website.

This project is far from a complete piece because of the time limit.
There were some parts that needed to be corrected, especially my
use of units in the CSS. If this website isn't viewed in a 16:9
viewport, then the entire thing looks wrong, which is an issue in
my opinion.

I have come far from this implementation in terms of my web
development abilities.

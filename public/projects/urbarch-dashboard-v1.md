# Urban Archaeology Dashboard v1
This project was implemented alongside the Urban Archaeology
website. The purpose was to provide a form structure to add
product data for the website. Because I'm the only person using
this version, it is in an incomplete state and using relatively
inefficient code implemented in Python and KivyMD.

The goal is to eventually create a dashboard using React Native
with more efficient code and more ease-of-use (now that I know
how the dahsboard would be used), so that Urban Archaeology can
edit the database using the dashboard themselves whenever they
need to after the website is complete.

# The Implementation
The implementation can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kalvingarcia/urbarch-dashboard-v1),
and won't work without the proper session files, which means that downloading and running the
code won't cause any issues with the existing database.

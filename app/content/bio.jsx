                    I am a Frontend Developer with extensive experience in React, Next, and AI development. I am always searching
                    for opportunities to apply my diverse skill set, which includes web design, front-end development, machine learning, 
                    and natural language processing. My projects, like Urban Archaeology's Website and Comensal, reflect my dedication
                    to creative problem-solving and innovative thinking. When I'm not coding, I'm fantasizing about how to make my office
                    space cooler. I enjoy long walks in the park with my partner, where we discuss the profound mysteries of life (the
                    plot lines of whatever show we're watching). Also, I firmly believe all offices should have emotional support cats,
                    and I'm willing to die on that hill.

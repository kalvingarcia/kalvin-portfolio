    "I am a Frontend Developer with extensive experience in React, Next, and AI development. I am always searching for opportunities to apply my diverse skill set, which includes web design, front-end development, machine learning, and natural language processing. My projects, like Urban Archaeology's Website and Comensal, reflect my dedication to creative problem-solving and innovative thinking. When I'm not coding, I'm fantasizing about how to make my office space cooler. I enjoy long walks in the park with my partner, where we discuss the profound mysteries of life (the plot lines of whatever show we're watching). Also, I firmly believe all offices should have emotional support cats, and I'm willing to die on that hill."

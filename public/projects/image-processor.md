# Image Processing Webapp
This project was created as an assignment during my undergraduate experience at
University of North Texas. The project was made in a group with 3 other developers.

## The Concept
Our main idea was to create a webapp for editing images that users could upload themselves.
The users could change the colors, add filters, or draw directly using the tools the webapp
provided.

## Research
For this project, I was tasked with researching accessibility, user interface, and user experience
for website and mobile applications. My research led to my understanding of how our project should
focus on the user's ability to use the website. We aspired to make the website availible for use even
on mobile devices, but we ran out of time, since the course was 1 semester long, and this was each
members first major project that didn't involve a command line.

Regardless, the aspiration to create an accessible piece of media for any kind of user has inspired my
design and development journey thus far. No matter what project I develop, if there is a UI involved, I
do my best to ensure the project has all the required parts to be truly usable and accessible to users.

## Implementation
The project was implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For more information about implementation
and my role for the code of the project, visit the [GitHub page](https://www.github.com/kalvingarcia/image-processor).

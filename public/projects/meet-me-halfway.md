# Meet Me Halfway
This was a project created with a team in my undergraduate experience. The project and assignment
was used to simulate creating designing a project in a team, with stakeholders involved. We had
weekly scrum meetings, stakeholder meetings, conducted research on our target audience, and created
presentations of the project and data for meetings.

For the course, we were assigned a project to create, rather than coming up an idea ourselves.

## The Concept
Sometimes 2 people need to meet halfway (more or less) between where they are. Common examples are 
custody exchanges or trying to meet a relative/friend who is passing through on a trip. It should 
have features like noting any favorites, suggesting nearby restaurants or police stations. Users 
need to be able to enter their address and the app gives them options on where to meet (that are 
near something â€“ so not in the middle of nowhere) based on their needs (e.g., at a police station).

## My Role
For this project, I was the lead designer and frontend developer. I focused myself on doing research
for the best user experience possible when using out application while creating a frontend that was
completely modular from the backend.

First I began with wireframing each page of our app, so we could have the concepts in place. To support
our cross-platform team, we opted to use Kivy for the UI developement. After doing more research, I found
Google's Material Design paradigm which focused on creating a consistent fontend experience for users.
Luckily, an open source project existed for creating Material Design focused Kivy projects, called KivyMD.

## Implementation
To see the implementation of the project visit the [GitHub page](https://github.com/WesleyGlover/TeamRocket).

Because the capstone was only one semester, the project wasn't able to be completed, but we created a working
[prototype of the application](https://youtu.be/RJxFxBBSO98?si=VhtufV9P4ziQqef8).

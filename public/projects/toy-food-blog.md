# Faux Food Blog Homepage
This project was my first attempt at developing a website
from scratch on my own. Not only was I attempting to showcase
my programming ability, but I was also trying to show my design
prowess. I didn't truly plan or design the website, and so 
development was extremely disorganized causing a lot of
confusion for me.

I'm sharing this project, despite it not being complete or something
I'd be proud of, because I feel like showing my failures and how I
learned from them is just as important as showcasing my current abilities.

## The Concept
I wanted to create a template style webpage, like you would find
in SquareSpace or Wix. The issue was I wanted it to be functional,
this meant instead of only focusing on coding a static, frontend
webpage, I ended up also attempting to create a backend. With no
plan set forth, I never completed the project, and scrapped it in
favor of other more interesting projects instead.

The concepts of this website will be used for a future project I'm working on
which will be a recipe sharing and meal preparation platform.

## The Design
The website was to be a recipe blog. The homepage having a featured recipes
section, as well as, a most recent recipe section. I implemented parallax scrolling
for the homepage components.

I also wanted to have a contact form in the footer:

## The Implementatiion
I decided to implement the project using Python and Django to create
a Restful API that the frontend could access. This was my first time
working with Django and Restful APIs. The API would have access to the
MySQL database and feed the information for recipes and ingredients to
the frontend.

This project's implementation can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/kalvingarcia/toy-food-blog).
I also have the [homepage](https://projects.kalvingarcia.com/toy-food-blog/)
hosted as a static site for viewing.

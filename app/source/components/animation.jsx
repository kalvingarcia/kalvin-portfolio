 * mounted even when not shown, use the Effect component.
 * 
 * @param props The Transition takes 5 props:
 *  *   The `show` prop defines whether the component should be rendered. *Defaults to false.*
 *  *   The `enter` and `exit` props define the class names that apply the CSS animations they 
 *      perform. **These props is required.**
 *  *   The `duration` prop is used to define how long the animation will take in terms of milliseconds. 
 *      *Defaults to 300ms*
 *  *   The `children` prop should only have 1 child. **This prop is required.**
 * @returns The child React component when `show` is true.

 * @param props The Effect component takes 6 props:
 *  *   The `start` prop defines whether the component should start the animation. *Defaults to false.*
 *  *   The `being`, `active`, and `end` props define the class names that apply the CSS styles at

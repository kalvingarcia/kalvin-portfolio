# Catalog Demo
This project was created to demonstrate how a catalog page could be filted and paginated. The concept was
created for Urban Archaeology, so it uses their branding and some of their products as examples. The colors
are placeholders and I chose them to look as ugly and distinguishable from the actual Urban website to not
confuse users.

## The Concept
While designing Urban's website, I noticed that currently their products are shown in a grid layout without
any filters or search functionality. The pages are clusted and there are a lot of redundant product listings
in different sections of the website. To aide with this problem, I suggested a catalog that shows all the
products we have in a filterable and searchable way, much like contemporary online retailers' websites do.

This demonstration was to help bridge the gap between what our website currently does, and how a modern
website would do so. The purpose was to ease the amount of imagining Urban would need to do inorder to
visualize their products in a catalog.

## The Implementation
The project was implemented using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For more information, see the
[GitHub page](https://www.github.com/kalvingarcia/catalog-demo).

## The Final Product
My final implementation of the Urban Archaeology website uses a slight variation of the catalog I demonstrated.
This is because I noticed that Urban likes to showcase 3 top products for each category, so I added a featured
product section that also gets filted based on what the user is looking for. That idea was present when I mocked
up the website's design.

Another change I made, search query parameters in the URL of the catalog. This gives users the ability to share
their catalog link to either Urban's salespeople or companions, and everyone will see the same page. These changes
were made to improve the quality of the catalog page, and add some ease of use.

# Toy Parser Implementation
This project was completed as part of my coursework. The main goal was
to learn how to implement a parser for a programming language using BNF
grammars.

The output is parse tree generator for programs that use a toy R BNF grammar
created by the instructor. The project was used to test my understanding of 
parsing and generating a parse tree without a parser generator, such as CUP. 
The lexical analyzer was created using JFlex.

This project was completed for my programming languages course on October 10, 2021,
and I created a compiler using JFlex and CUP in the following year for my compilation
methods course.
